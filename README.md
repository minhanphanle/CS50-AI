# CS50-AI
This repository contains all Projects in the CS 50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course.

## Course Overview & Project Outline
The course covers various concepts, algorithms, and AI libraries that lay a strong foundation for a general understanding of what Artificial Intelligence is. Every week requires students to submit a quiz and hands-on projects to demonstrate their understanding of the topic.

### Week 0: Search
The course starts off with search, introducing foundational concepts of how an agent could find a solution to a problem such as navigating from a point to a destination or playing a chess game.
- Concepts: agent, state, actions, transition model, state space, goal test, path cost
- Algorithms: Depth-first Search, Breadth-first Search, Greedy best-first search, A* search with Manhatten distance heuristic, Minimax (adversarial search)
