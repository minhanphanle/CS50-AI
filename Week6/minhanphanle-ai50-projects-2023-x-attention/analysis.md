# Analysis

## Layer 1, Head 4

& Layer 1, Head 3

Both of these attention diagrams show the relationship between verb and its preposition with their orders swapped between the two diagrams. The preposition provides relational information regarding the verb, in this case pick "up" and stumble "across"

Example Sentences:

- Then I picked up a [MASK] from the table
- I stumble across this [MASK] by chance

## Layer 8, Head 7

Adjective usually depends on the noun that follows it, hence this attention heads pay attention to the word "day" to determine the [MASK] word which is supposed to be an adjective. Even when they do not stand next to each other, the adjective at the end of the sentence for example still finds the noun that it is supposed to modify (in the case of the sentence "That idea is [MASK]")

Example Sentences:

- It is a [MASK] day. Layer 8, head 8
- That idea is [MASK]. Layer 10, head 2
